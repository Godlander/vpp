# [v++](https://github.com/Godlander/vpp/releases/latest)

A vanilla minecraft complimentary resourcepack focused on improving visual quality and the survival experience.

This pack uses vanilla shaders, which are likely incompatible with Optifine, Sodium, or any other mod that affects client side rendering.

For more information on what's included, check out [changelog.txt](changelog.txt)

### If you don't want the entire pack, here are my own separate modules:

## [RealMaps](modules/RealMaps.zip)

More realistic map colors using a core shader.

Map icons are also tweaked a bit.

## [AnimatedSkin](modules/AnimatedSkin.zip)

Allows custom animation of the face by encoding animation data in skin texture. Also works for player head item/block.

In multiplayer, anyone using AnimatedSkin or v++ above version 2.1 will be able to see the animation.

Check [the guide](modules/Animated%20Skin.md) to see how to encode animation in your own skin.
